              Gideon and his hundred men got to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch,
              just after the sentries had been posted. They blew the trumpets, at the same time smashing
              the jars they carried. All three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held
              the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands, ready to blow, and
              shouted, "A sword for God and for Gideon!" They were stationed all around the camp, each man
              at his post. The whole Midianite camp jumped to its feet. They yelled and fled. When the
              three hundred blew the trumpets, God aimed each Midianite's sword against his companion, all
              over the camp. They ran for their lives - to Beth Shittah, toward Zererah, to the border of
              Abel Meholah near Tabbath.
